# Edge Computing Performance
Project for the Distributed Development Course at PoliMi and FER
## Introduction
Traditional cloud computing networks are highly centralized, with data being gathered on the outermost edges and transmitted back to the main servers for processing. This architecture grew out of the fact that most devices near the edge did not have the processing power and memory capacity to analyze or process the collected data.

Today approximately 94 percent of enterprises use the cloud and its structure tends to be increasingly overloaded. It is in this context that Edge Computing was born to help the computation to be spreaded over multiple nodes that are closer to the end user.

The project aims to develop a comparison between a standard cloud application and an architecture with the presence of edge nodes. An application for video streaming and chatting will be developed in both architectures and the objective will be to demonstrate the greater efficiency of cloud computing when using the edge architecture.
As a deliverable, a working conferencing application will be created. Its users will be able to view and upload audio-video streams and use a chat system.
